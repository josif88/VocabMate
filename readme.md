Do you find that once you have translated the word or phrase you forgot the meaning by the next day? and struggling to memorise the meaning of foreign words and phrases?

Vocabmate is a fantastic new app that uses a scientifically proven method to help you translate and remember multiple words and phrases on the go.

There are lots of translation apps out there that can help you quickly discover the meaning of words and phrases, and there are also lots of apps that can help you learn a foreign language.

### Vocabmate has been created to help you do both effectively.

Vocabmate solves the most common problem that second language speakers have — remembering the meaning of keywords and phrases.



#### This simple, scientifically proven method can help you memorise keywords and phrases in as little as a few days!

To learn and remember words and phrases effectively, you need to be exposed to the word or phrase multiple times. Research has found that it can take up to 30 exposures. There are lots of translation apps already out there that allow you to translate words and phrases and store them for future reference. The problem is we live in a very noisy world and there is always something vying for our attention. When we find ourselves with a long and overwhelming list of words and phrases to learn, it becomes a chore, so we switch off and don’t dedicate the time needed to memorise them. Vocabmate is a translation app with a difference. We use scientifically proven methods to help you effectively memorise the foreign vocabulary you want to learn in manageable, bite-size pieces.

## Who's need it?

Vocabmate is perfect for students, second language speakers and anyone who is looking to enrich their vocabulary in any language. It can translate words and phrases from and to 180 languages. You simply choose your native language and target language and input the words you want to learn. The app is perfect for beginners who are looking for an effective way to learn basic vocabulary in different languages

## How does it work?

1- By manually input words and phrases, select text and click Memorize from context menu or by extract text from an image you taken. 

2- You then add that word or phrase to a reminder list for a week or a fixed period of your choice. 

During that period, the app randomly sends you push notifications asking you the meaning of the word or phrase. If you can’t remember, you can open up the app to check. 
You continue this process until you have memorised the word and learn it by heart.
